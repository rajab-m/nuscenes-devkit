the data used in this project is the mini version of the full dataset (which contains 10 scenes) and can be downloaded from https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#download
the main code is called occupancy_grid_lidar.ipynb and located in the tutorial folder "nuscenes-devkit-lidar-occupancy-grid/python-sdk/tutorials/", and there is another python class for lidar utils can be found in the same location
It is important to set the dataroot of the Nuscenes database correctly in line 4 of file (lidar_utils.py)
